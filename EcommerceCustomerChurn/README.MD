# Welcome to Ecommerce Churn Prediction Project
Hi, my name is Rendi. This is my Data Science project about ecommerce industry. In this project, I will do data wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), machine learning modeling, web app deployment, and the most important is solve the business problem regarding customer churn of ecommerce. The deployed web app can be used to predict a customer will be churn or not automatically. Beside that, you can create your own machine learning model without writing a single line of code. 

## Background
Maybe lately we often hear the word Ecommerce, but do you know what Ecommerce means? According to Investopedia, Ecommerce or Electrical Commerce is business model that allows companies or individuals to buy and sell goods and service over internet<sup>[1]</sup>. There are many challenges to be faced in Ecommerce. One of the challenges that must be faced is customer churn. Customer churn is when our customer no longer purchases or interact with our business<sup>[2]</sup>. But can't we solve this problem by acquiring new customers? Well, cost to acquire new customers is 5 time more than keep an existing ones<sup>[3]</sup>. Therefore, acquiring new customers not the right solution. <p align = 'center'>

To solve that problem is actually quite simple, we just need preventing churn before it happens. Customer churn prevention can be done by predicting which customer will be churn (predictive analytics) and take action for the customer (persepective analysis). Predictive analytics requires various statistical techniques, such as data mining (pattern recognition) and machine learning (ML)<sup>[4]</sup>. Meanwhile, perspective analysis requires strong domain knowledge to be able to take appropriate action. <p align = 'center'>

The impact of preventing customer churn is increasing customer retention rate. If we can increase retention rate only 5%, our profit will increase 25% - 95%<sup>[5]</sup>. Beside that, we can minimize losses from customer churn, around $1.6 trillion per year<sup>[3]</sup>.
