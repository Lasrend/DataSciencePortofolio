Nowadays, medical insurance is something importance for us. Having insurance makes our hearts calmer than not having it because every time we get sick, medical insurance will pay for our treatment. However, every year the cost of treatment increases, while the cost to pay for insurance is quite difficult to increase so the company must calculate the risk profile of each customer properly so as not to suffer losses. This project will try to solve this problem by finding out what variables must be considered in determining the charges for each customer and this project will try to automate in determining the charges.
