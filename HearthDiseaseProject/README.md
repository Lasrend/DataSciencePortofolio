# Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset
This is my first end-to-end Data Science project that incoporates Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning Modeling, and Web App Deployment. The deployed web app used to predict a person's risk of heart disease.

## Background
Do you know what heart disease is the most common? According to Central for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), the most common type of heart disease in the United States is <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/coronary_ad.htm"> Coronary Artery Disease(CAD) </a><sup>[1]</sup>. CAD affect is decreased blood flow so it can cause a hearth attack. Symptomps of CAD may be different from person to person and unfortunately many people don't have symptomps<sup>[2]</sup> so they need to do medical check up to know it. In USA, 45% percent people who get heart attacks do not realize they have heart disease like CAD<sup>[3]</sup>, this situation can be called as "Silent Hearth Attack" <p>
In Indonesia, the cost of heart disease treatment is between Rp203.700.000 - Rp404.000.000<sup>[4]</sup> and maybe it can be more than that. Accroding to CDC, High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. If we look that key risk, most of the reason a person who can get heart disease are due to their lifestyle so to avoid heart disease actually we just need to maintain our lifestyle and often check our heart health. Why do we still need to frequently check our heart health if we have maintain our lifestyle? Is'nt that enought? Well, there is other causes beside that, family history. In some case, there are people who often do exercises, but because that person have family history of heart disease, that person also has heart disease<sup>[5]</sup> . So maintain our lifestyle to keep healthy is a good thing, but we still need to check our heath health to make sure our heart is fine and we can do prevention from heart attack.  <p>
Based on what has been explained, I create this project that can estimate risk of someone based on their clinical information. Why did I think to make this project? There is a problem that arises, The cost of doing medical check up for our heart health. We need to spend around Rp50.000 - Rp7.000.000 in Indonesia to do full medical check up for our heart and imagine we need do this every year<sup>[6]</sup>, very expensive. So with this project, I hope I can help many people to keep checking his heart health frequently at a low cost, even for free. If this project estimate a big risk that people has heart disease, then that person can confirm it at the hospital. Beside that, I hope I can reduce the percentage of people who get "Silent Heart Attack". <p>
